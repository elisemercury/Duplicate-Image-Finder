**difPy** is a Python package that automates the search for duplicate/similar images.

.. note::
   âœ¨ difPy is now available as **app for your desktop**! `Learn more <https://difpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resources/desktop.html>`_.

difPy searches for images in **one or more directories**, compares the images it found and checks whether these are duplicates. It then outputs the **image files classified as duplicates**, as well as the **images having the lowest resolutions**, so that you know which of the duplicate images are safe to be moved/deleted. You can then either move/delete them manually, or let difPy do this for you.

difPy does not compare images based on their hashes. It compares them based on their tensors i. e. the image content. This allows you to let difPy **not only search for duplicate images, but also for similar images**.

difPy leverages Python's multiprocessing capabilities and is therefore able to perform at high performance even on large datasets. 

View difPy on `GitHub <https://github.com/elisemercury/Duplicate-Image-Finder>`_ and `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/difPy/>`_.
