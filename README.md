**Tired of going through all images in a folder and comparing them manually to check if they are duplicates?**

:white_check_mark: The Duplicate Image Finder (difPy) Python package **automates** this task for you!

```python
pip install difPy
```
> :point_right: difPy v2.4.x  has some **major updates** and **new features**. Check out the [release notes](https://github.com/elisemercury/Duplicate-Image-Finder/releases/) for a detailed listing.

> :open_hands: Our motto? The more users use difPy, the more issues and missing features can be detected, and the better the algorithm gets over time. **Contributions are always welcome** - check our [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/elisemercury/Duplicate-Image-Finder/wiki/Contributing-to-difPy) for more information.

Read more on how the algorithm of difPy works in my Medium article [Finding Duplicate Images with Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/finding-duplicate-images-with-python-71c04ec8051).

## Description
DifPy searches for images in **one or two different folders**, compares the images it found and checks whether these are duplicates. It then outputs the **image files classified as duplicates** and the **filenames of the duplicate images having the lower resolution**, so you know which of the duplicate images are safe to be deleted. You can then either delete them manually, or let difPy delete them for you.

</p>

DifPy does not compare images based on their hashes. It compares them based on their tensors i. e. the image content - this allows difPy to not only search for duplicate images, but also for similar images.

## Basic Usage
Use the following function to make difPy search for duplicates within one specific folder and its subfolders:

```python
from difPy import dif
search = dif("C:/Path/to/Folder/")
``` 
To search for duplicates within two folders and their subfolders:

```python
from difPy import dif
search = dif("C:/Path/to/Folder_A/", "C:/Path/to/Folder_B/")
``` 
Folder paths must be specified as a Python string.

## Output
DifPy gives two types of output that you may use depending on your use case: 

A **dictionary** of duplicates/similar images that were found, where the keys are a **unique id** for each image file:

```python
search.result

> Output:
{20220824212437767808 : {"filename" : "image1.jpg",
                         "location" : "C:/Path/to/Image/image1.jpg"},
                         "duplicates" : ["C:/Path/to/Image/duplicate_image1.jpg",
                                         "C:/Path/to/Image/duplicate_image2.jpg"]},
...
}
``` 

A **list** of duplicates/similar images that have the **lowest quality:** 

```python
search.lower_quality

> Output:
["C:/Path/to/Image/duplicate_image1.jpg", 
 "C:/Path/to/Image/duplicate_image2.jpg", ...]
``` 

DifPy can also generate a **dictionary** with statistics on the completed process:

```python
search.stats

> Output:
{"directory_1" : "C:/Path/to/Folder_A/",
 "directory_2" : "C:/Path/to/Folder_B/",
 "duration" : {"start_date": "2022-06-13",
               "start_time" : "14:44:19",
               "end_date" : "2022-06-13",
               "end_time" : "14:44:38",
               "seconds_elapsed" : 18.6113},
 "similarity_grade" : "normal",
 "similarity_mse" : 200,
 "total_images_searched" : 1032,
 "total_dupl_sim_found" : 1024}
``` 

## CLI Usage
You can make use of difPy through the CLI interface by using the following commands:

```python
python dif.py -A "C:/Path/to/Folder_A/"

python dif.py -A "C:/Path/to/Folder_A/" -B "C:/Path/to/Folder_B/"
```
It supports the following arguments:

```python
dif.py [-h] -A DIRECTORY_A [-B [DIRECTORY_B]] [-Z [OUTPUT_DIRECTORY]] 
       [-s [{low,normal,high,int}]] [-px [PX_SIZE]] [-p [{True,False}]] [-o [{True,False}]]
       [-d [{True,False}]] [-D [{True,False}]]
```
The output of difPy is then written to files and saved in the working directory by default, or to the folder specified in the `-Z / -output_directory` parameter. The "xxx" in the filename is a unique timestamp:

```python
difPy_results_xxx.json
difPy_lower_quality_xxx.txt
difPy_stats_xxx.json
```

> :notebook: For a **detailed usage guide**, please view the official **[difPy Usage Documentation](https://github.com/elisemercury/Duplicate-Image-Finder/wiki/difPy-Usage-Documentation)**.

## Additional Parameters
DifPy has the following optional parameters:

```python
dif(directory_A, directory_B, similarity="normal", px_size=50, 
    show_progress=True, show_output=False, delete=False, silent_del=False)
```
### similarity (str, int)

Depending on which use-case you want to apply difPy for, the granularity for the classification of the images can be adjusted. DifPy can f. e. search for exact matching duplicate images, or images that look similar, but are not necessarily duplicates.

`"normal"` = (**recommended**, default) searches for duplicates with a certain tolerance

`"high"` = searches for duplicate images with extreme precision, f. e. for use when comparing images that contain a lot of details like f. e. text

`"low"` = searches for similar images

To customize the classification threshold and define the MSE value manually, you can set `similarity` to any integer.

### px_size (int)

! Recommended not to change default value

Absolute size in pixels (width x height) that the images will be compressed to before being compared.
The higher the px_size, the more computational ressources and time required. 

### show_progress (bool)

Per default, difPy will set this parameter to ``True``, so that you can see where your lengthy processing is. Change this value to ``False`` to disable the progress bar.

```False```= (default) no progress bar is shown

```True``` = outputs a progress bar

### show_output (bool)

Per default, difPy will output only the filename of the duplicate images it found. If you want the duplicate images to be shown in the console output, change this value to `True`.

`False`= (default) outputs filename of the duplicate/similar images found

`True` = outputs a sample and the filename

### delete (bool)

! Please use with care, as this cannot be undone

When set to `True`, the lower resolution duplicate images that were found by difPy are deleted from the folder. Asks for user confirmation before deleting the images. To skip the user confimation, set silent_del to `True`.  
                           
### silent_del (bool)

! Please use with care, as this cannot be undone

When set to `True`, the user confirmation is skipped and the lower resolution duplicate images that were found by difPy are automatically deleted from the folder.
